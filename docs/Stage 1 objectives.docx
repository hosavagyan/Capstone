Basic data evaluation and exploration : 
Technical overview and understanding of the subject matter
Read about the topic and understand the terms mentioned in the data
Understand the particulars about the collection of data, is it aggregated?
Exploration and evaluation of the available data and information. Understand the mening of each data column
Exploration of the inverter behaviour within plants
Study the power generation behaviour of a single inverter and its evolution/changes in time
Study and compare the behaviour between different inverters in the same plant
	Questions to answer:
Explore the DC to AC conversion behaviour
Can we study the behaviour and any changes it has in time for a single inverter? Look at a several cases and think of an automatic way for checking the rest of inverters
Can we compare the behaviour of different inverters? Is there correlation between them in time? Are some more correlated then others? Are some more different than others?
Explore the variable daily yield
Explore the variable total yield
Study the power generation behaviour of a single inverter relative to weather conditions or relative to the module temperature (here assume that the module temperature is correlated with the temperature of the panels present in a particular plant)
	Questions to answer:
Explore inverter temperature with respect to weather conditions, irradiation or the power generated during the day
Explore AC power relative to ambient temperature, inverter temperature, irradiation
Explore DC power relative to ambient temperature, inverter temperature, irradiation
Explore daily yield relative to average daily temperature, irradiation
